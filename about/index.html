I&rsquo;m the creator of TillyNet—a self-hosted, segmented lab environment that simulates enterprise-grade infrastructure. Built from the ground up using open-source tools and industry-standard practices, TillyNet includes VLAN-based network segmentation, centralized firewalling, containerized services, internal DNS, and automated deployment pipelines. This lab serves as both a learning environment and a proving ground for real-world IT architecture and network design.
Professionally, I have a solid background in systems support, cybersecurity compliance, and enterprise operations. I currently support The Department of Defense networks with a focus on asset lifecycle management, automation, and secure IT service delivery. I hold active Cisco CCNA (200-301) and CompTIA Security&#43; certifications and am currently working toward the Cisco CCNP as I continue developing my technical depth in modern networking.">
