<meta name="description" content="About Me
I’m the creator of TillyNet—an enterprise-grade, self-hosted lab environment designed to simulate real-world production networks. Built from scratch using open-source tooling, routed VLAN segmentation, containerized services, internal PKI, SSO, recursive DNS, and automated deployment pipelines, TillyNet continues to evolve as a full-stack testing platform for SDN, automation, and advanced networking.
Professionally, I support the U.S. Department of Defense as a Network Engineer focused on secure enclave operations, high-availability infrastructure, and enterprise-scale automation. I manage and maintain the U.S. Marine Corps’ classified and unclassified Base Area Networks (BAN/LAN) across SDA fabric sites—delivering mission-critical connectivity for thousands of users. My work spans routing architecture, encrypted transport, OSPF/BGP redistribution, real-time diagnostics, multi-VRF segmentation, and full-stack SDA operations using Cisco Catalyst Center.">
