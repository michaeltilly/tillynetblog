      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post documents the troubleshooting process I followed to resolve an internet connectivity issue affecting virtual machines (VMs) hosted on a Proxmox VE node running on a Wi-Fi-only Dell XPS 15. The VMs were deployed on a routed internal subnet (&lt;code&gt;172.30.30.0/24&lt;/code&gt;) with static routes configured through a pfSense firewall. While the VMs could communicate with internal hosts—including DNS and gateway IPs—they were unable to reach external internet addresses such as &lt;code&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
