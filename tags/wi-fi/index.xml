      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post documents the troubleshooting process I followed to resolve an internet connectivity issue affecting virtual machines (VMs) hosted on a Proxmox VE node running on a Wi-Fi-only Dell XPS 15. The VMs were deployed on a routed internal subnet (&lt;code&gt;172.30.30.0/24&lt;/code&gt;) with static routes configured through a pfSense firewall. While the VMs could communicate with internal hosts—including DNS and gateway IPs—they were unable to reach external internet addresses such as &lt;code&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I document how I deployed Proxmox VE on a Dell XPS 15 laptop with no physical Ethernet interface. This machine was added to my home lab as a standalone hypervisor, running independently from my main Protectli-based Proxmox node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the XPS lacks wired connectivity, I had to work through some unique networking constraints, including bridging over Wi-Fi and enabling connectivity for guest virtual machines. This write-up covers the initial NAT-based setup and the transition to a cleaner routed network model with static routes via pfSense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
