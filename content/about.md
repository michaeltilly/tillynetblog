# About Me

I'm the creator of **TillyNet**, a fully segmented home lab environment built from the ground up using tools like Proxmox, pfSense, Cisco switches, and TP-Link APs. What started as a curiosity has turned into a full-blown SDN playground.

I am an IT professional with a foundation in systems support, cybersecurity compliance, and enterprise IT operations—actively transitioning into a career in network engineering. I recently earned my Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA 200-301) and hold a CompTIA Security+ certification, with plans underway to achieve the CCNP as I deepen my expertise in advanced networking technologies.  
  
I bring hands-on experience with enterprise tools such as Active Directory, PowerShell, and BMC Remedy, and have developed automation workflows and SOPs to support secure environments. I also hold an active DoD Tier 3 Secret Clearance, allowing me to operate confidently in both classified and unclassified enclaves.  
  
While I’m not currently in a dedicated networking role, I’m fully committed to building real-world networking experience—spending my own time studying, labbing, and staying current with modern routing, switching, and network security practices.  
  
I’m eager to join a team where I can apply my existing skill set, grow as a network engineer, and contribute to building reliable, secure, and scalable IT infrastructure.  
  
Let’s connect—especially if you're looking for someone with the motivation to learn fast, the discipline of a DoD environment, and the technical drive to grow into a high-performing networking professional.

## Why I Built TillyNet

I wanted hands-on experience that went beyond certification books — so I built a real-world network with isolated VLANs, LXC containers, local recursive DNS, firewall segmentation, and full automation pipelines. I even performed remote network recovery using OpenVPN tunnels from my phone.
