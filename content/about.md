# About Me

Hi, I’m Michael Tillman — an IT Specialist with a passion for **network engineering**, **virtualization**, and **self-hosted infrastructure**.

I'm the creator of **TillyNet**, a fully segmented home lab environment built from the ground up using tools like Proxmox, pfSense, Cisco switches, and TP-Link APs. What started as a curiosity has turned into a full-blown SDN playground.

## Why I Built TillyNet

I wanted hands-on experience that went beyond certification books — so I built a real-world network with isolated VLANs, LXC containers, dynamic DNS, firewall segmentation, and full automation pipelines. I even performed remote network recovery using OpenVPN tunnels from my phone.

- **Step-by-step blog posts** from each phase of the network buildout
- **Fixes and gotchas** from hands-on networking
