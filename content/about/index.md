# About Me

I'm the creator of **TillyNet**—a self-hosted, segmented lab environment that simulates enterprise-grade infrastructure. Built from the ground up using open-source tools and industry-standard practices, TillyNet includes VLAN-based network segmentation, centralized firewalling, containerized services, internal DNS, and automated deployment pipelines. This lab serves as both a learning environment and a proving ground for real-world IT architecture and network design.

Professionally, I have a solid background in systems support, cybersecurity compliance, and enterprise operations. I currently support The Department of Defense networks with a focus on asset lifecycle management, automation, and secure IT service delivery. I hold active Cisco CCNA (200-301) and CompTIA Security+ certifications and am currently working toward the Cisco CCNP as I continue developing my technical depth in modern networking.

I bring hands-on experience with enterprise tools such as Active Directory, PowerShell, and Python, and have authored automation workflows and SOPs that improve IT processes in highly regulated environments. I also maintain an active DoD Tier 3 Secret Clearance, enabling me to operate confidently across both classified and unclassified enclaves.

Although I’m not yet in a dedicated networking role, I’m actively building production-style experience in my lab—exploring modern routing and switching, infrastructure-as-code, and SDN concepts.

I’m excited to apply my skills to environments that value security, reliability, and scalable infrastructure—and to continue growing into a high-performing network engineer.

## Why I Built TillyNet

I needed hands-on experience that extended beyond textbooks and certifications. TillyNet reflects my initiative to recreate enterprise-level infrastructure: isolated VLANs, containerized services, local recursive DNS, access controls, virtual firewalls, remote VPN connectivity, and full-stack service automation. It’s a platform for learning, testing, breaking, and rebuilding—exactly like production.
