# About Me

I’m the creator of **TillyNet**—an enterprise-grade, self-hosted lab environment designed to simulate real-world production networks. Built from scratch using open-source tooling, routed VLAN segmentation, containerized services, internal PKI, SSO, recursive DNS, and automated deployment pipelines, TillyNet continues to evolve as a full-stack testing platform for SDN, automation, and advanced networking.

Professionally, I support the **U.S. Department of Defense** as a Network Engineer focused on secure enclave operations, high-availability infrastructure, and enterprise-scale automation. I manage and maintain the U.S. Marine Corps’ classified and unclassified Base Area Networks (BAN/LAN) across SDA fabric sites—delivering mission-critical connectivity for thousands of users. My work spans routing architecture, encrypted transport, OSPF/BGP redistribution, real-time diagnostics, multi-VRF segmentation, and full-stack SDA operations using Cisco Catalyst Center.

I hold the **Cisco Certified Network Professional – Enterprise (CCNP Enterprise)** certification, along with the **Cisco Certified Specialist – Enterprise Core (CCS-ECore)** and **Automating and Programming Cisco Enterprise Solutions (ENAUTO)** specialist certifications. These reflect my depth in enterprise networking, software-defined architectures, and network automation. I also maintain **Cisco CCNA** and **CompTIA Security+**, and I operate under a **DoD Tier 3 Secret Clearance**, enabling me to support both classified and unclassified domains confidently and securely.

I specialize in proactive network reliability—identifying, diagnosing, and resolving complex issues before they impact operations—and continuously improving the resilience and visibility of the infrastructure I support. Whether operating independently or in collaboration with Watch Officers, I maintain real-time situational awareness of routing behavior, authentication systems, device health, and enclave interoperability.

Outside my DoD work, TillyNet serves as my platform to push boundaries: SDN, LISP/VXLAN, multi-VRF segmentation, PKI hierarchy engineering, reverse-proxy and identity integration, IaC workflows, Python API tooling, and distributed authentication systems. It’s where I experiment, break things, learn, and rebuild with precision.
